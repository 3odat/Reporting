## ✅ What We’ve Learned: Context Engineering Principles

Over the last phase of our research, we conducted a deep dive into the concept of **context engineering** for LLM-based agents, especially those based on **ReAct-style planning**.

Here’s a summary of what we’ve discovered:

### 1. **What is a Context Window?**

The **context window** is the LLM’s **active short-term memory**. It includes:

* System prompts
* User prompts
* Tool descriptions
* Observations/results
* Recent message history

> ⚠️ **Important**: The LLM does *not* remember earlier messages unless they are explicitly included again.

### 2. **The 4 Core Strategies of Context Engineering**

| Strategy             | Description                                                        | Benefit                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Write Context**    | Inject a `task frame`: goal, constraints, success criteria         | Keeps agent aligned with mission           |
| **Select Tools**     | Only include **active tools** per step (not all tools)             | Reduces errors, shortens prompt size       |
| **Compress Results** | Summarize tool outputs into 2–5 bullet points with references      | Keeps results readable and token-efficient |
| **Isolate Context**  | Separate tool-specific reasoning (e.g., nav vs vision) when needed | Enhances focus and reduces noise           |

## 🛩️ Context Engineering Example in a Drone Agent

### Mission:

> "Survey the west field, fly at 20m altitude, count cars, and land when 3 cars are detected or 8 minutes pass."

### 🟥 Before Engineering (Raw)

* 🧠 System Prompt: 800 tokens, verbose
* 🛠️ Tools: 12+ (even unrelated ones like `upload_map`, `stream_video`)
* 📜 Full Logs: raw telemetry + detection JSON pasted
* 🧾 History: 15 previous messages pasted

> 🧨 Result: Token overflow risk, incorrect tool usage, high latency

---

### ✅ After Engineering (Clean)

* 🔧 Tools: Only 3 active (`takeoff`, `goto`, `detect_objects`)
* 🧭 Task Frame:

  ```
  goal: Survey west field
  constraints: altitude = 20m; time ≤ 8 min
  done_when: cars ≥ 3 OR timeout
  ```
* 📋 Observations:

  * `cars_detected=2 (conf=0.89) src=detect#7`
  * `battery=91% src=telemetry#4`
* 💬 Chat History: 2–3 trimmed turns
* 🧠 Scratchpad: "Step: takeoff → goto → detect loop → land"

> ✅ Result: Shorter context, safer tool use, stable reasoning

## 📊 Before vs After (Context Comparison)

| Component       | Before Engineering | After Engineering               |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| System Prompt   | Long, unfocused    | Short, role-based               |
| Tool Exposure   | All tools shown    | Only phase-relevant tools shown |
| History         | Full chat pasted   | Trimmed + summarized            |
| Observations    | Full JSON pasted   | 2–4 bullets with references     |
| Cost & Latency  | Higher             | Lower                           |
| Output Accuracy | Often off-track    | Focused, on-task                |

## 🎯 Next Steps: Agent Design Plan (Based on Context Engineering)

We will now **design and implement** a context-engineered LangGraph agent using the following steps:

| Phase                       | Objective                                                   | Notes                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **1. Task Frame Design**    | Build a reusable `goal + constraints + done_when` structure | Inject on every call           |
| **2. Tool Controller**      | Dynamically expose tools based on mission phase             | Avoid tool confusion           |
| **3. Summarization Layer**  | Create a summarizer for tool outputs → bullets              | e.g., `battery=83% src=tele#3` |
| **4. Memory Trim Strategy** | Build a sliding window with summaries for history           | Keep tokens low                |
| **5. Agent Skeleton**       | Implement LangGraph with ReAct-style loop + context engine  | Already prototyped             |

## 🧠 Knowledge Takeaway

> **LLM agents don’t remember — you have to *engineer* what they see.**

Context Engineering lets us **treat the LLM like a controlled CPU**, managing its short-term memory (context window) like a clean, evolving cache.

By making each turn *clear*, *lean*, and *goal-focused*, we transform agents from “chatty assistants” to structured, mission-aware collaborators.

## 📌 Summary

| Key Concept             | Impact on Agent Behavior                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Context Window          | Limits what the agent can see and reason over |
| Engineering the Window  | Makes reasoning more accurate and cheaper     |
| Tool Selection Strategy | Prevents accidental use of wrong tools        |
| Summarization           | Keeps results interpretable + saves tokens    |
| Task Frame              | Acts as a persistent compass for the mission  |
